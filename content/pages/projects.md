## Projects

* [Calorie logger](https://github.com/OrthogonalScribe/calorie-logger) - a simple Yesod web application for logging food intake. Future features may include auto-importing of food items from external sources, a REST API, and others (see the roadmap)
* [Baktu](/baktu) - a tool to create and manipulate backup repositories in a simple augmented rsnapshot-like format, written in Rust
